# Dibby, Your Friendly Printer Assistant

This chatbot, named Dibby, was designed as part of a project submitted to NYU's Hack Dibner Competition. The project won first place in the competition.
The chatbot utilizes TensorFlow to perform intent-based classification on users' input and respond accordingly. The chatbot functions as a personal printer assistant, aiding students with any questions they may have about the printing process at NYU's Dibner Library. It can answer general inquiries about printing or help students troubleshoot specific printing problems.
Included in this repository is a video, serving as introduction into our chatbot. Additionally, there is a paper describing the entire breadth of the project. Finally, there's a presentation which was used for the project pitch.
